# Financial Calculator

- **Welcome to the Financial Calculator project! This project provides two useful financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.**

# Features

# Investment Calculator
- **The Investment Calculator helps you determine how much your investment will grow over time. You can choose between simple interest and compound interest calculations.**

- **Simple Interest: Calculates the total amount of your investment based on a fixed annual interest rate and the number of years you plan to invest.**
- **Compound Interest: Calculates the total amount of your investment based on a fixed annual interest rate, the number of times interest is applied per year, and the number of years you plan to invest.**
  
# Bond Calculator
- **The Bond Calculator helps you figure out your monthly repayments for a home loan (also known as a mortgage). It calculates the monthly repayment amount based on the principal loan amount, annual interest rate, and the total repayment period in months.**
